## Tax rates
You might want to have different tax rates depending on the country where the buyer comes from.

To archive this, the ESD plugin will create a new tax group while installing the plugin.
Within the administration go to `settings->tax` and you'll find the newly created tax group "ESD tax rates".
This group contains all European countries with it's VAT rates.

The default tax rate is set to 19%. So if you're not logged in for example and therefore 
don't have a shipping country yet, you will see the default tax rate.

**Please double check the VAT rates, to be 100% sure those are correct.**

You need to assign this **ESD tax group** to your article.
Go to your ESD product and select the **ESD** tax group within the price section.

Now: If your shop is based for example in Germany ( 19% VAT ) and a customer from Portugal ( 23% VAT ) is ordering an ESD article
within your shop - The ESD product will be taxed with the 23% VAT from Portugal, and not with 19% from Germany.
